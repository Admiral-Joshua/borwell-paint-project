Please see the documentation in this repository if you'd like to learn more about the tool, and how to use it.

Prequisitories:
The only real thing you should need to run the application is .NET Framework 4.6
I wrote it in Visual Studio 2017, and .NET Framework 4.5 comes pre-installed in Windows 10,
so you should be able to use a copy of Windows 10, but if it doesn't work, you'll have to
update / upgrade to .NET Framework 4.6

I have packaged the tool into handy EXEs for Windows users. And I will also
 have a friend of mine help build it into a Linux package too! See the bin folder
 for these.
