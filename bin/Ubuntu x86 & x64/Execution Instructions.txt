For running the Linux verison, you're gonna need monodevelop. If you're not sure you have it
try running mono --version... If that works, you got it,
else you'll have to download it. 

Just Google MonoDevelop. You should find some instructions online or somewhere to help
you get that set-up. Once that's done, you should be able to run this program straight away
using the command:

mono <executable name>

E.g.
mono Borwell_Paint_Project.exe

Although, on further inspection it does also run using wine, if that is easier to use / install
however I can't recommend this... it doesn't look so pretty... doesn't seem to support transparency layers at all.
